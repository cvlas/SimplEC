1) Fix relative_complement_all
2) (DONE) the first condition should always be an event in all init/term rules
3) (DONE) automatic declarations generation
	a) (DONE) Distinguish SD from Simple Fluents
	b) (DONE) Distinguish input from output entities
	c) (DONE) Remove duplicates and redundancies
	d) (DONE) Caching Order

4) Clean and document source code
5) (DONE) Fix union_all's that have 3 arguments
6) Optimize interval manipulation constructs
7) (DONE) Make interval names shorter
8) Eliminate interval counter gaps (I1, I2, I13, I14, I29...)
9) (DONE) First argument of complement_all has to be a List
