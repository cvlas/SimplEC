1)  (DONE) Fix relative_complement_all
2)  (DONE) First condition should always be an event in all init/term rules
3)  (DONE) Automatic declarations generation
	a) (DONE) Distinguish SD from Simple Fluents
	b) (DONE) Distinguish input from output entities
	c) (DONE) Remove duplicates and redundancies
	d) (DONE) Caching Order 
		  (Found flaws on the first approach. Second approach seems to work well)
4)  Clean and document source code
5)  (DONE) Fix union_all's that have 3 arguments
6)  (DONE) Optimize interval manipulation constructs
7)  (DONE) Make interval names shorter
8)  Eliminate interval counter gaps (I1, I2, I13, I14, I29...)
9)  (DONE) First argument of complement_all has to be a List
10) (DONE) Add full-stops at the end of all rules
11) (DONE) Setup gitlab project for the compiler with (pending/resolved) issues. Grant access to AA
12) (DONE) Write the MARITIME, CAVIAR and CTM action descriptions in the simplified language of the compiler
13) (DONE) Automatically construct the dependency graph of the action description
14) (IN PROGRESS) Produce a log file of the compilation, reporting syntax errors (if any) in the input provided by the user
15) (DONE) Simplify BNF: add more Event-Calculus jargon
16) (IN PROGRESS) Make dependency graphs pretty (Use caching-order-like layers and colours)
